`math-edu`, `math-edu-plus` (currently rewritten to `mathlify`) are Javascript libraries I'm building for working with common mathematical objects encountered in high school mathematics. 

Planned features:

- Classes: fractions, surds/radicals, vectors, complex numbers
- Each class comes with built-in methods
- `toString` method converts to $\\LaTeX$ string

Used in my other projects:
- [Math Atlas](https://math-atlas.vercel.app)
- [Math Bounty](https://math-bounty.vercel.app)
- [Math Interactive](https://math-interactive.vercel.app)
- [3D Vectors](https://3d-vectors.vercel.app)
- [Math Quiz](https://math-quizzes.vercel.app)
