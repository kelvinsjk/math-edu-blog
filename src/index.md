math-edu is a math library I'm building for working with common number types encountered in high school mathematics. 

Planned features:

- Classes: fractions, surds/radicals, vectors, complex numbers
- Each class comes with built-in functions commonly encountered
- toString method converts to $\\LaTeX$ string

Used in my other projects:
- [Math Atlas](https://math-atlas.vercel.app)
- [3D Vectors](https://3d-vectors.vercel.app)
